- emails into actionable items
- calendar to<>from actionable items
- like front
- but also with reminders
- event-driven system
- somebody needs to activate an event
    - browser plugin
- you need to subscribe to event
    - subscribe to being notified by the event of certain type
    - snooze events of certain type
- "i want to know when applications for grant open here."
    - then they open applications and activate a grant.
    - somebody needs to trigger an event.
- pull pane for quick management, not web-based
- serves as "event system" - gathers events and notifications - your "pulse".
- events across two dimensions - time and type (similar to front).
    - but front is only time and contacts.
    - we need something for general, any "event", not just when we are contacted.
- zapier basically, but something that works with zapier directly - i.e. just reads data from it, doesn't do anything special by itself.
- tweetdeck
- events catcher, cathing zapier events as well
- notifications into actionable items
- more control:
    - don't see of that type/category, snooze
    - assign to someone else (collaborative aspect can be really cool)
- cumulative events (debounced) => all events into one until you act on it (i.e. "see all these signups")
